# Peer Identification

This section details the methodologies used for peer identification, a critical component in assessing fairness and auditing bias. 
Peer identification is the process of selecting similar entities (or "peers") within a dataset, which serves as a baseline for comparison. This process is essential for evaluating how each entity is treated relative to its peers, thereby allowing us to audit and quantify algorithmic bias.
